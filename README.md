# a_bunch_of_HASKELL
<p style="width:300px;">
Basically all i learned from university and Learnyouahaskell.com is in this repo, from the basics of functional programming all the way up to monads.

The first files with numbers in their names are the chapters from Learnyouahaskell.com. I did not copy every example from the site, because many of them were run directly in the terminal.

The rest of the files are exercises from my university labs.
