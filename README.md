Basically all i learned from university and <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters"> Learnyouahaskell.com</a> is in this repo, from the basics of functional programming all the way up to monads.

The first files with numbers in their names are the chapters from Learnyouahaskell.com. I did not copy every example from the site, because many of them were run directly in the terminal so that i can understand how they work.

The rest of the files are exercises from my university labs.
